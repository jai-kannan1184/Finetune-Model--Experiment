"Sure, here's a suggestion for hyperparameters for the given architecture trained on the ImageNet 1k dataset. Please note that these are just starting points and the actual optimal hyperparameters may require further tuning and experimentation.

}
```

Here's a brief explanation of these choices:

- **Learning Rate**: A moderate learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as a starting point. This might need to be adjusted based on the training and validation loss curves.
- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 128 is chosen considering the large size of the ImageNet dataset and assuming a decently powerful GPU. If memory issues arise, this can be reduced.
- **Optimizer**: Adam is a good default choice of optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each weight individually.
- **Weight Initialization**: He Normal initialization is chosen because of the use of LeakyReLU activation in the network.
- **Epochs**: Training for 100 epochs is a reasonable starting point for ImageNet. Early stopping should be used based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
- **Learning Rate Decay**: The learning rate is decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 30 epochs to allow more fine-grained updates as training progresses.
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss is appropriate for multi-class classification tasks like ImageNet.
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization is used to prevent overfitting, with a small regularization strength of 0.0001. L1 regularization is not used (set to 0.0)."
