In this JSON:

- The `model` section describes the architecture of the MLP.
- The `training` section describes the hyperparameters for training the model:
  - `optimizer` is set to Adam, a commonly used optimizer for MLPs, with a learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay for regularization.
  - `loss_function` is set to CrossEntropyLoss, suitable for multi-class classification tasks like ImageNet 1k.
  - `batch_size` is set to 128, a common choice for image datasets.
  - `epochs` is set to 100, but you should monitor validation loss and use early stopping if the model starts to overfit.
  - `learning_rate_scheduler` is set to StepLR, which decays the learning rate by a factor of `gamma` every `step_size` epochs. This can help the model converge more effectively."
