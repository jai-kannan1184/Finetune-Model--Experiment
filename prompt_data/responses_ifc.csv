"Sure, here's a general guideline for the hyperparameters when training a model on the ImageNet-1k dataset:

```json
{
    ""learning_rate"": ""0.1 (initial, but it's often reduced during training using a learning rate schedule)"",
    ""batch_size"": ""256 or 512 (depends on the computational resources)"",
    ""num_epochs"": ""90-100 (can vary based on the specific setup and early stopping criteria)"",
    ""optimizer"": ""Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum"",
    ""loss_function"": ""Cross-Entropy Loss (for multi-class classification tasks)"",
    ""scheduler"": ""StepLR, MultiStepLR, or ReduceLROnPlateau (to adapt the learning rate during training)"",
    ""step_size"": ""Often set based on the number of epochs, e.g., reduce the learning rate every 30 epochs"",
    ""gamma"": ""Commonly set to 0.1 (for reducing the learning rate in learning rate schedules)"",
    ""momentum"": ""0.9 (when using SGD with momentum)""
}
```

Please note that these are general guidelines and the optimal hyperparameters can depend on many factors, including the specific model architecture, the hardware available, and the latest advances in research. It's often a good idea to perform systematic hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or Bayesian optimization) to find the best hyperparameters for your specific setup."

"Sure, here's a general guideline for the hyperparameters in the format you requested. Please note that these are just starting points and may need to be adjusted based on your specific use case, model architecture, and the results of your initial training runs:

```json
{
    ""learning_rate"": ""0.1"",
    ""batch_size"": ""256"",
    ""num_epochs"": ""90-100"",
    ""optimiser"": ""SGD"",

    ""gamma"": ""0.1 (for StepLR, adjust based on your specific use case)"",
    ""momentum"": ""0.9""
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each hyperparameter:

- **learning_rate**: The amount that the weights are updated during training is referred to as the step size or the ""learning rate"".
- **batch_size**: Number of training examples utilized in one iteration.
- **num_epochs**: The number of passes through the entire training dataset.
- **optimiser**: The optimization algorithm used to update the weights.
- **loss_function**: The function that calculates the difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **scheduler**: Adjusts the learning rate during training.
- **step_size**: The number of epochs after which the learning rate is decayed by a factor of gamma.
- **gamma**: The factor by which the learning rate is reduced at each 'step_size'.
- **momentum**: The parameter that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.

Remember, these are just starting points. Hyperparameter tuning is a large part of training a deep learning model, and these values may need to be adjusted to optimize performance for your specific task."
