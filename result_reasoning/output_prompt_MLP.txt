Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom MLP model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the machine learning community.

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001 - 0.01", 
    // A smaller learning rate ensures that the model does not miss any local minima, but it also slows down the training process. A larger learning rate speeds up the training but risks overshooting the minimum.

    "batch_size": "16 - 128", 
    // A smaller batch size can offer a regularizing effect and lower generalization error, but it also makes the training less stable. A larger batch size makes the training more stable, but it also requires more memory.

    // The number of epochs should be large enough to allow the model to converge, but not too large to avoid overfitting.

    "optimiser": "SGD, Adam", 
    // SGD and Adam are commonly used optimizers. SGD is simple and easy to implement, but it may be slower to converge. Adam combines the advantages of other extensions of SGD and performs well in practice.

    "loss_function": "CrossEntropyLoss", 
    // CrossEntropyLoss is suitable for multi-class classification problems like ImageNet.

    "scheduler": "StepLR, ExponentialLR", 
    // Learning rate schedulers can help to adjust the learning rate during training. StepLR reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs. ExponentialLR reduces the learning rate exponentially.

    "step_size": "10 - 30", 
    // This is for StepLR. It defines the number of epochs after which the learning rate is reduced.

    "gamma": "0.1 - 0.9", 
    // This is for both StepLR and ExponentialLR. It is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced.

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001 - 0.01", 
    // A smaller learning rate is often better for convergence, but it also means the training process will be slower. A range of 0.0001 to 0.01 is a good starting point.

    "batch_size": "16 - 128", 
    // A smaller batch size can provide a regularizing effect, but it also means the gradient estimate will be noisier. A larger batch size allows for more parallelism and thus faster training, but it also requires more memory.

    "num_epochs": "10 - 100",

    // CrossEntropyLoss is a common choice for multi-class classification problems like ImageNet.

    "scheduler": "StepLR, ExponentialLR", 
    // Learning rate schedulers can help to adjust the learning rate during training to achieve better convergence. StepLR reduces the learning rate by a fixed factor every few epochs, while ExponentialLR reduces the learning rate exponentially after each epoch.

    "step_size": "10 - 30", 
    // For the StepLR scheduler, the step size determines how often the learning rate is reduced. A common choice is to reduce the learning rate every 10 to 30 epochs.

    "gamma": "0.1 - 0.9", 
    // The gamma parameter determines the factor by which the learning rate is reduced. A common choice is to reduce the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 to 0.9.

    "momentum": "0.5 - 0.9"    
    // Momentum can help to accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampen oscillations. A common choice is to set the momentum between 0.5 and 0.9.

Please note that these are just starting points and the optimal hyperparameters can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. It's often a good idea to use a systematic approach like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters.

Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom MLP model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are also provided.

1. "learning_rate": 0.0001 to 0.1. The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters to tune. A smaller learning rate means the model learns slowly and needs more epochs to train, while a larger learning rate means the model learns quickly but may overshoot the optimal solution.

2. "batch_size": 32 to 256. The batch size determines how many examples the model sees before it updates its weights. A smaller batch size means the model updates more frequently but may be more susceptible to noise in the data, while a larger batch size means the model updates less frequently but the updates are based on a more accurate estimate of the gradient.

3. "num_epochs": 10 to 100. The number of epochs determines how many times the model goes through the entire dataset. More epochs mean the model has more opportunities to learn from the data, but also increases the risk of overfitting.

4. "optimizer": SGD, Adam, RMSprop. These are some of the most commonly used optimizers. SGD is simple and effective, but may require more tuning of the learning rate and momentum. Adam and RMSprop automatically adjust the learning rate during training, which can make them easier to use.

5. "loss_function": CrossEntropyLoss. This is a common loss function for multi-class classification problems like ImageNet.

6. "scheduler": StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR. These are learning rate schedulers that adjust the learning rate during training. They can help the model converge faster and reach a better solution.

7. "step_size": 1 to 10. This is a parameter for the StepLR scheduler that determines how often the learning rate is reduced.

8. "gamma": 0.1 to 0.9. This is a parameter for the StepLR and ExponentialLR schedulers that determines how much the learning rate is reduced.

9. "momentum": 0.5 to 0.99. This is a parameter for the SGD optimizer that helps accelerate gradient descent in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.

Here is the final format:

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001 to 0.1",
    "batch_size": "32 to 256",

    "loss_function": "CrossEntropyLoss",
    "scheduler": "StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR",
    "step_size": "1 to 10",
    "gamma": "0.1 to 0.9",
    "momentum": "0.5 to 0.99"

    "scheduler": "StepLR, ExponentialLR", 
    // Learning rate schedulers can help to adjust the learning rate during training. StepLR reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs, while ExponentialLR reduces the learning rate exponentially after each epoch.

    "step_size": "10 - 30", 
    // This is the number of epochs before the learning rate is reduced by the scheduler. It should be set based on how quickly you expect the model to converge.

    "gamma": "0.1 - 0.9", 
    // This is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced. A smaller gamma reduces the learning rate more aggressively.

    "momentum": "0.5 - 0.9" 
    // Momentum helps to accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It can be set to a value close to 1 for high-dimensional problems.

Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom MLP model on the ImageNet dataset. The ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the machine learning community.

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001 - 0.01",
    "batch_size": "16 - 128",

}

Explanation:

- Learning rate: This is a critical hyperparameter. Too high, and the model may not converge. Too low, and the model may train too slowly. A common range is 0.0001 to 0.01.

- Batch size: This depends on the memory of your GPU. Larger batch sizes allow the model to learn more stable and generalized features but may lead to slower convergence. A common range is 16 to 128.

- Number of epochs: This is the number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network. Too few epochs can result in underfitting of the model, while too many can result in overfitting. A common range is 10 to 100.

- Optimizer: SGD and Adam are commonly used. SGD is simple and easy to understand, making it a good choice for most problems. Adam, on the other hand, adapts the learning rate for each weight individually and is more robust to initial learning rate and provides some regularization effects.

- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss is commonly used for multi-class classification problems like ImageNet.

- Scheduler: Learning rate schedulers gradually decrease the learning rate during training to help the model converge. StepLR reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs, while ExponentialLR reduces the learning rate exponentially after each epoch.

- Step size: This is used in StepLR and is the number of epochs before the learning rate drops. A common range is 5 to 30.

- Gamma: This is the factor by which the learning rate decreases. A common range is 0.1 to 0.9.

- Momentum: This is used in SGD to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. A common range is 0.5 to 0.99.
