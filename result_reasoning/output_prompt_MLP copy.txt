Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom MLP model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the machine learning community.

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001 - 0.01", 
    // A smaller learning rate ensures that the model does not miss any local minima, but it also slows down the training process. A larger learning rate speeds up the training but risks overshooting the minimum.

    "batch_size": "16 - 128", 
    // A smaller batch size can offer a regularizing effect and lower generalization error, but it also makes the training less stable. A larger batch size makes the training more stable but requires more memory.

    "num_epochs": "10 - 100", 
    // The number of epochs should be large enough to allow the model to converge, but not too large to avoid overfitting.

    "optimiser": "SGD, Adam", 
    // SGD and Adam are commonly used optimizers. SGD is simple and efficient, but it may require careful tuning of the learning rate. Adam adapts the learning rate for each weight individually and is less sensitive to the initial learning rate.

    "loss_function": "CrossEntropyLoss", 
    // CrossEntropyLoss is suitable for multi-class classification problems like ImageNet.

    "scheduler": "StepLR, ExponentialLR", 
    // Learning rate schedulers gradually decrease the learning rate during training to help the model converge. StepLR reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs. ExponentialLR reduces the learning rate exponentially after each epoch.

    "step_size": "10 - 30", 
    // This is the number of epochs before the learning rate drops in StepLR. It should be set based on how fast you want the learning rate to decrease.

    "gamma": "0.1 - 0.9", 
    // This is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced. A smaller gamma reduces the learning rate more.

    "momentum": "0.5 - 0.9" 
    // Momentum helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It should be set close to 1 for a heavy ball, which will have more momentum and be less sensitive to small gradients.

Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom MLP model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the machine learning community.

1. "learning_rate": The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters. Too high, and the model might overshoot the optimal solution. Too low, and the model might take too long to converge or get stuck in a local minimum. A common range to try is [0.001, 0.01, 0.1].

2. "batch_size": The batch size can affect both the speed and quality of the model's learning. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster training, but might also result in a less optimal solution. A common range to try is [32, 64, 128, 256].

3. "num_epochs": The number of epochs is the number of times the model will iterate over the entire dataset. Too few, and the model might underfit. Too many, and the model might overfit. A common range to try is [10, 50, 100].

4. "optimizer": The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the model's weights. Common choices are SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), RMSprop, and Adam. 

5. "loss_function": The loss function is what the model tries to minimize. For multi-class classification problems like ImageNet, a common choice is CrossEntropyLoss.

6. "scheduler": The learning rate scheduler adjusts the learning rate during training. Common choices are StepLR, which reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs, and ReduceLROnPlateau, which reduces the learning rate when the model's performance plateaus.

7. "step_size": This is the number of epochs before the learning rate is reduced. A common range to try is [10, 30, 50].

8. "gamma": This is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced. A common range to try is [0.1, 0.5, 0.9].

9. "momentum": This is a parameter for the SGD optimizer that helps accelerate learning. A common range to try is [0.5, 0.9].

Here is the final format:
