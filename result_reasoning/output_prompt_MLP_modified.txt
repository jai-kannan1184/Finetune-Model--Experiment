Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these choices are explained below:

1. Learning Rate: This is one of the most important hyperparameters. If it's too high, the model might overshoot the optimal point. If it's too low, the model might take too long to converge or get stuck in a local minimum. A common range to try is [0.001, 0.01, 0.1].

2. Batch Size: This depends on the memory of your GPU. Larger batch sizes allow the model to process more data at once, but also require more memory. A common range to try is [32, 64, 128, 256].

3. Number of Epochs: This is the number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network. Too few epochs can result in underfitting of the model, while too many epochs can result in overfitting. A common range to try is [10, 50, 100].

4. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the weights of the network. Common choices are SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), RMSprop, and Adam. 

5. Loss Function: This is the function that the model tries to minimize. For multi-class classification problems like ImageNet, CrossEntropyLoss is a common choice.

6. Scheduler: This is used to adjust the learning rate during training. Common choices are StepLR, which reduces the learning rate by a factor every few epochs, and ReduceLROnPlateau, which reduces the learning rate when the validation loss has stopped improving.

7. Step Size: This is the number of epochs before the learning rate drops in StepLR. A common range to try is [5, 10, 20].

8. Gamma: This is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced in StepLR. A common range to try is [0.1, 0.5, 0.9].

9. Momentum: This is a parameter used in SGD to prevent the optimizer from getting stuck in local minima. A common range to try is [0.5, 0.9].

Here is the final format:

{
    "learning_rate": [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    "batch_size": [32, 64, 128, 256],
    "num_epochs": [10, 50, 100],
    "optimizer": ["SGD", "RMSprop", "Adam"],
    "loss_function": ["CrossEntropyLoss"],
    "scheduler": ["StepLR", "ReduceLROnPlateau"],
    "step_size": [5, 10, 20],
    "gamma": [0.1, 0.5, 0.9],
    "momentum": [0.5, 0.9]
}
Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the deep learning community.

1. "learning_rate": The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters. A common range to try would be [0.001, 0.01]. Too high a learning rate can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while too low a learning rate can cause the process to get stuck.

2. "batch_size": The batch size is typically chosen based on the memory limit of your GPU. Common choices are 32, 64, 128, or 256.

3. "num_epochs": The number of epochs is usually set based on how long you are willing to train and how quickly your model appears to be converging. A common range might be [50, 100].

4. "optimizer": The choice of optimizer can significantly affect your model's performance. Common choices are SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), RMSprop, and Adam.

5. "loss_function": For a multi-class classification problem like ImageNet, the Cross Entropy Loss is a common choice.

6. "scheduler": Learning rate schedulers can help to adjust the learning rate during training. Common choices are StepLR, MultiStepLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau.

7. "step_size": For the StepLR scheduler, a common choice for step_size might be [30, 50].

8. "gamma": For the StepLR scheduler, a common choice for gamma might be [0.1, 0.5].

9. "momentum": For optimizers that use momentum (like SGD), a common choice might be [0.9, 0.99].

Here is the final format:

{
    "learning_rate": [0.001, 0.01],
    "batch_size": [32, 64, 128, 256],
    "num_epochs": [50, 100],
    "optimizer": ["SGD", "RMSprop", "Adam"],
    "loss_function": ["Cross Entropy Loss"],
    "scheduler": ["StepLR", "MultiStepLR", "ReduceLROnPlateau"],
    "step_size": [30, 50],
    "gamma": [0.1, 0.5],
    "momentum": [0.9, 0.99]
}

Please note that these are just suggested ranges and the optimal hyperparameters can vary depending on the specific problem and model architecture. It's always a good idea to experiment with different values and monitor the training and validation performance to find the best hyperparameters for your specific case.

8. Gamma: This is the factor by which the learning rate is reduced. A common range is [0.1, 0.9].

9. Momentum: This is used with some optimizers like SGD to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. A common range is [0.5, 0.99].

Here are some suggested hyperparameter ranges for fine-tuning your custom model on the ImageNet dataset. The reasons for these ranges are based on common practices and empirical results from the machine learning community.

1. "learning_rate": A common range for the learning rate is between 0.0001 and 0.1. The learning rate controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. Choosing the learning rate is challenging as a value too small may result in a long training process that could get stuck, whereas a value too large may result in learning a sub-optimal set of weights too fast or an unstable training process.

2. "batch_size": The batch size is typically chosen between 1 and the total number of samples in the training dataset. Common batch sizes range from 32 to 256. The batch size can influence the gradient descent process, where smaller batches can result in a noisy gradient signal and larger batches can result in a more accurate estimate of the gradient.

3. "num_epochs": The number of epochs is often set between 10 and 100, although it really depends on when your model starts to overfit. This is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

4. "optimizer": The choice of optimizer can significantly affect your model's performance. Common choices are SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. Adam is often recommended as the default optimizer to use, and it combines the best properties of the AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms.

5. "loss_function": For multi-class classification problems like ImageNet, the cross-entropy loss function is commonly used.

6. "scheduler": Learning rate schedulers can adjust the learning rate during training. The StepLR scheduler is a common choice, which multiplies the learning rate by a factor every few epochs.

7. "step_size": This is used with the StepLR scheduler and is typically set to a value where the learning rate will be reduced after a certain number of epochs. A common range could be between 5-20.

8. "gamma": This is also used with the StepLR scheduler and is the factor by which the learning rate gets multiplied. A common value is 0.1.

9. "momentum": Momentum is used with SGD optimizer and is typically set between 0.5 and 0.9. Momentum can help accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.

Here is the final format:

{
    "learning_rate": "0.0001-0.1",
    "batch_size": "32-256",
    "num_epochs": "10-100",
    "optimizer": "SGD, Adam, RMSprop",
    "loss_function": "CrossEntropyLoss",
    "scheduler": "StepLR",
    "step_size": "5-20",
    "gamma": "0.1",
    "momentum": "0.5-0.9"
}
